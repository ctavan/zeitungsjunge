          <h2>I do not understand how this works.</h2>
          Amazon allows sending personal documents to your Kindle. These documents can be almost anything, e.g. books or websites.
          <em>Zeitungsjunge</em> allows you to subscribe to publicly accessible news sources. <em>Zeitungsjunge</em> will download this source for you and process it in a way that it looks
          like an actual newspaper. The result will be sent to your Kindle for you to read it.
          <br>To make this possible you need to add <span style="color:#A00">zustellung@zeitungsjunge.tk</span> to your Kindle personal document e-mail list.
          <br><br>
          
          <h2>What is my Kindle e-mail?</h2>
          You can send  <em>personal documents</em> to your Kindle using your Kindle e-mail. You find it in your Kindle menu. To allow us to send anything you need to add <span style="color:#A00">zustellung@zeitungsjunge.tk</span> to your 
          <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=200767340#approvefrom" title="approveMail">approved personal document e-mail list</a>.
          <br><br>
          
          <h2>Why don't you serve my favorite newspaper?</h2>
          We will add more sources in the future. If you are looking for something particular <a href="/contact" title="contact">let us know</a>.
          <br><br>
          
          <h2>My subscription doesn’t work anymore.</h2>
          Sometimes websites are changing. This means that we have to adjust the download script. We try to keep our eyes open, but if we miss anything, please <a href="/contact" title="contact">let us know</a>.
          <br><br>
          
          <h2>The same article appears in different issues.</h2>
          Every subscription will download all articles from approximately the last 25h. Therefore there is a small overlap by design. Also updated articles might appear twice.
          And of course, if you download from the same source twice a day you will get the same articles again. 
          <br><br>
          
          <h2>Why is my subscription different from the print version.</h2>
          We only download from the newspaper's websites. They usually differ from the print versions.
          <br><br>
          
          <h2>What means morning, noon and evening?</h2>
          Since we cannot control exact times of delivery we decided to be a bit fuzzy here. We use European time,
          i.e. morning is something between 6am and 9am CET.
          <br><br>

          <h2>Isn't it filling up my storage pretty quick?</h2>
          One paper is between 100 and 500 kB, so two subscriptions per day will produce approximately 300 MB per year.
          You can of course delete items on your device or online after reading.
          <a href="http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=1899660&postcount=1" title="approveMail">Here</a> is a post which explains how to do this more quickly.
          <br><br>
          
          <h2>Why did you do it?</h2>
          To practice setting up a web application.
          The back-end is written in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodejs" title="nodejs">node.js</a>,
          the project is hosted by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Elastic_Compute_Cloud" title="aws">Amazon Web Services</a>
          and I use <a href="http://sendgrid.com/" title="sendgrid">SendGrid</a> to send the mails.
          I also use command-line tools from <a href="http://calibre-ebook.com/" title="calibre">calibre</a> and some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)" title="python">Python</a> scripts to download and process the papers.
          The source code is <a href=" https://github.com/mariokonschake/zeitungsjunge" title="git">here</a>.
